Malaria is the deadliest disease in the earth and big hectic work for the health department. The traditional way of diagnosing malaria is by schematic examining blood smears of human beings for parasite-infected red blood cells under the microscope by lab or qualified technicians. This process is inefficient and the diagnosis depends on the experience and well knowledgeable person needed for the examination. Deep Learning algorithms have been applied to malaria blood smears for diagnosis before. However, practical performance has not been sufficient so far. 
This paper proposes a new and highly robust machine learning model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which automatically classifies and predicts infected cells in thin blood smears on standard microscope slides. A ten-fold cross-validation layer of the convolutional neural network on 27,558 single-cell images is used to understand the parameter of the cell. Three types of CNN models are compared based on their accuracy and select the precise accurate - Basic CNN, VGG-19 Frozen CNN, and VGG-19 Fine Tuned CNN. Then by comparing the accuracy of the three models, the model with a higher rate of accuracy is acquired.


**#Existing System**
The traditional way of diagnosing malaria is by schematic examining blood smears of human beings for parasite-infected red blood cells under the microscope. It was done qualified technicians in laboratories.

**#Proposed System**
This paper proposes a new and highly robust machine learning model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which automatically classifies and predicts infected cells in thin blood smears on standard microscope slides.
The proposed work starts with decision taking whether the cell is infected or not.
Then start training the machine by giving all the attributes of the images.
Once all the images are acquired, the training process gets started followed by validation, and testing.
After receiving desired accuracy, the developed model is ready for use with real malaria samples.
